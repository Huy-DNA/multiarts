## Terminology

A register can be categorized based on 3 dimensions:
- Range: Boolean and Multi-valued.
  - Boolean registers can only store either 0 or 1.
  - Multi-valued registers can store more than 2 values.  
- Participants: MRMW, MRSW, SRSW.
  - MRMW registers stand for Multi-reader, Multi-writer registers.
  - MRSW registers stand for Multi-reader, Single-writer registers.
  - SRSW registers stand for Single-reader, Single-writer registers. 
- Safety: Safe, Regular, Atomic. 

## Problem

It's well known that all types of registers are equivalent in power and equivalent with the atomic snapshot object.

The problem of register construction asks how to reconstruct **a register of type A** from **registers of type B** in a *wait-free* manner.

The problem of atomic snapshot construction asks how to construct **an atomic snapshot object** from **read-write registers** in a *wait-free* manner.

## Challenges

1. The book's implementation of atomic snapshot seems to have some problems: The number of registers = The number of threads & Each register is only modified by one thread. However, I think an atomic snaphot object should allow an arbitrary number of registers and each register should be modifiable by any threads?

   Updated: https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/AtomicSnapshots.html states that an atomic snapshot is an array of MRSW registers... so maybe the book is correct.

   Updated: What is implemented in the book and here is termed single-writer atomic snapshot objects. To quote [Atomic Snapshots of Shared Memory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/93385.93394), "a *single-writer snapshot memory*, in which each word may be updated by only, one process, from single-writer, n-reader registers". What I had in mind was a *multi-writer snapshot memory*.

3. Unbounded timestamp required...

   Updated: See [Bounded Concurrent Time-Stamp Systems Are Constructible](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/73007.73051).
